# Website Sean


## Website description
This website is created for viewers to get to know me and see work I have previously done. There is also a contact me page, where the viewer can full out a form which sends me an email. 

## Testing/Findings 

- My first problem I had was with css. I noticed when testing my first page that my external css wasn't being registered. Only internal and inline styles were working. Through alot of googling and trial and error, I noticed that I used the src tag when trying to link my stylesheet instead of href.

- Responsiveness was another problem I had with a few of my html pages. When creating my website I was using bootstrap, bootstrap classes have alot of predefined styles e.g padding and margin. From removing inline styles and creating classes, I found out that It was a predefined bootstap class which was stuffing up the page allowing the viewer to scroll left and right.

Need to talk about how I was just using bootstrap and the bootstrap sight if I got stuck or looked at bootsrap website for inseperation
